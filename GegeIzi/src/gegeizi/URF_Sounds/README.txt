URF is a loving and amazing Manatee and we love him to death.
He was so kind to be a voice actor for our program that he loaned us his majestic sound.
I was excited to add these sounds into the program, it was going to be the greatest joy.
However, these sounds are so powerful, that they ended up occupying 90% of my processor;
resulting in me not being able to use these URF sounds leaving me at woe.
